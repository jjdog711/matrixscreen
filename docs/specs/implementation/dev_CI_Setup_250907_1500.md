# CI Setup Documentation - Phase 1

**Created:** 2025-09-07 15:00 UTC  
**Session:** Phase 1, Session 7  
**Purpose:** Document CI setup and how to run verification tasks

## CI Tasks Overview

Phase 1 includes basic CI tasks to ensure code quality and build stability. These tasks are designed to be run locally and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Available CI Tasks

### Debug CI Check
```bash
.\gradlew.bat ciCheck
```
**What it does:**
- Runs `assembleDebug` to build the debug APK
- Runs `testDebugUnitTest` to execute all unit tests
- Provides success/failure feedback

### Release CI Check
```bash
.\gradlew.bat ciCheckRelease
```
**What it does:**
- Runs `assembleRelease` to build the release APK
- Runs `testReleaseUnitTest` to execute all unit tests
- Provides success/failure feedback

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
# Debug build
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug

# Release build
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

### 2. Test Verification
```bash
# Unit tests only
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest

# All tests
.\gradlew.bat test
```

### 3. Hilt DI Verification
The Hilt dependency injection setup can be verified by:
- Successful build compilation (no DI errors)
- Unit tests passing (including `HiltIntegrationTest`)
- Debug harness accessible in debug builds

## Current Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (22 tests)
- **Data Layer Tests:**
  - `MappersTest.kt` - Proto ↔ domain mapping
  - `MatrixSettingsTest.kt` - Domain model validation
  - `SettingsRepositoryTest.kt` - Repository functionality
  - `ProtoMigrationTest.kt` - Legacy migration logic

- **UI Layer Tests:**
  - `NewSettingsViewModelTest.kt` - UDF ViewModel logic
  - `HiltIntegrationTest.kt` - DI module verification

### Integration Tests
- Debug harness provides end-to-end testing of persistence → ViewModel → UI flow
- Accessible via long-press on Matrix screen (debug builds only)

## Static Analysis (Future)

Currently, static analysis tools are not configured but are planned for future phases:
- **Detekt** - Kotlin static analysis
- **Ktlint** - Kotlin code formatting
- **Android Lint** - Android-specific checks

These will be added in later phases with warn-only configuration initially.

## CI Pipeline Integration

For CI/CD integration, use the `ciCheck` task:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run CI Checks
  run: ./gradlew ciCheck
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. Check for Hilt DI errors in compilation output
2. Verify all dependencies are properly configured
3. Ensure BuildConfig is generated (check `buildFeatures.buildConfig = true`)

### Test Failures
1. Run individual test classes to isolate issues
2. Check for missing test dependencies
3. Verify test data and mocks are properly set up

### DI Issues
1. Ensure `@HiltAndroidApp` is on Application class
2. Verify `@AndroidEntryPoint` is on MainActivity
3. Check that all DI modules are properly annotated

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 CI setup is considered complete when:
- ✅ `ciCheck` task runs successfully
- ✅ All unit tests pass (22/22)
- ✅ Debug and release builds compile
- ✅ Hilt DI graph resolves without errors
- ✅ Debug harness is accessible and functional

## Next Steps

Future phases will add:
- Static analysis tools (detekt, ktlint)
- UI tests with Compose testing
- Performance testing hooks
- Accessibility testing
- Release pipeline automation
